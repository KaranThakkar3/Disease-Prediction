# Disease-Prediction
#### The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify diseases based on the symptoms presented by patients. 

Train dataset: Consists of 4920 records. This dataset will be used to train the machine learning algorithm.

Test dataset: Contains 42 records. It will be used to check the model performance on unseen data. 

The datasets contain 132 features that represent 132 different symptoms and 1 column named “prognosis” that represents the response variable
The project is divided into 3 phases:
Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to gain insights to the data
Phase 2: Grouping similar diseases using K-Means Clustering in order to narrow down on the prognosis
Phase 3: Selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm. Following methods were tested: 
        • Multinomial Logistic Regression
        • Random Forest
        • Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
        • K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Phase 4: Evaluating the model's accuracy and other evaluation metrics to determine its effectiveness
