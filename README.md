# Disease-Prediction
#### The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify diseases based on the symptoms presented by patients. 

**Train dataset**: Consists of 4920 records. This dataset will be used to train the machine learning algorithm.  
**Test dataset**: Contains 42 records. It will be used to check the model performance on unseen data. 

The datasets can be downloaded from here:

They contain 132 features that represent 132 different symptoms and 1 column named “prognosis” that represents the response variable. 

**The project is divided into 4 phases:**  
&emsp; Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights to the data  
&emsp; Phase 2: Grouping similar diseases using K-Means Clustering in order to narrow down on the prognosis  
&emsp; Phase 3: Selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm. Following methods were tested:   

        • Multinomial Logistic Regression          
        • Random Forest
        • Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
        • K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
&emsp; Phase 4: Evaluating the model's accuracy and other evaluation metrics to determine its effectiveness
